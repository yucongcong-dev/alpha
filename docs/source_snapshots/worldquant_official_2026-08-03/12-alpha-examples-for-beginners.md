## Operating Earnings Yield

Hypothesis
If the operating income of a company is currently higher than its past 1 year history, buy the company’s stock and vice-versa.

Implementation
Using ts_rank to identify current performance of the company compared to its own history, using the fundamental data field "operating_income".

Hints to Implement
Rather than comparing the value directly, can calculating a ratio that includes stock market moves, improve the signal?

### Simulation Example

Settings:
```json
{
  "instrumentType": "EQUITY",
  "region": "USA",
  "universe": "TOP3000",
  "delay": 1,
  "decay": 0,
  "neutralization": "SUBINDUSTRY",
  "truncation": 0.08,
  "pasteurization": "ON",
  "unitHandling": "VERIFY",
  "nanHandling": "OFF",
  "language": "FASTEXPR",
  "maxTrade": "OFF"
}
```

Expression:
```text
ts_rank(operating_income,252)
```

## Appreciation of liabilities

Hypothesis
An increase in the fair value of liabilities could indicate a higher cost than expected. This may deteriorate the company's financial health, potentially leading to lower profitability or financial distress.

Implementation
Go short when there is an increase in the fair value of liabilities within a year and long when the opposite occurs using fundamental data.

Hints to Implement
Could observing the increase over a shorter period improve accuracy?

### Simulation Example

Settings:
```json
{
  "instrumentType": "EQUITY",
  "region": "USA",
  "universe": "TOP3000",
  "delay": 1,
  "decay": 0,
  "neutralization": "SUBINDUSTRY",
  "truncation": 0.08,
  "pasteurization": "ON",
  "unitHandling": "VERIFY",
  "nanHandling": "OFF",
  "language": "FASTEXPR",
  "maxTrade": "OFF"
}
```

Expression:
```text
-ts_rank(fn_liab_fair_val_l1_a,252)
```

## Power of leverage

Hypothesis
Companies with high liability-to-asset ratios – excluding those with poor financial health or weak cashflows – often leverage debt as a strategic tool to pursue aggressive growth initiatives. By effectively utilizing financial leverage, these firms are more likely to deliver outsized returns, as they reinvest borrowed capital into high-potential opportunities.

Implementation
Use the ‘liabilities’ and ‘assets’ to design the ratio.

Hint to improve the Alpha
This ratio can vary significantly across industries. Would it be worth considering alternative neutralization settings?

### Simulation Example

Settings:
```json
{
  "instrumentType": "EQUITY",
  "region": "USA",
  "universe": "TOP3000",
  "delay": 1,
  "decay": 0,
  "neutralization": "MARKET",
  "truncation": 0.01,
  "pasteurization": "ON",
  "unitHandling": "VERIFY",
  "nanHandling": "OFF",
  "language": "FASTEXPR",
  "maxTrade": "OFF"
}
```

Expression:
```text
liabilities/assets
```

## Earnings Yield Momentum

Hypothesis
Stocks whose earnings yield has been high more often over the last quarter, relative to their own history, may be undervalued thus we should long them

Implementation
Use EPS-to-price ratio as earnings yield proxy, compare over its own past, and compare it within its industry.

Hint to improve the Alpha
Use NAN HANDLING to preprocess data and boost the performance

### Simulation Example

Settings:
```json
{
  "instrumentType": "EQUITY",
  "region": "USA",
  "universe": "TOP3000",
  "delay": 1,
  "decay": 0,
  "neutralization": "INDUSTRY",
  "truncation": 0.08,
  "pasteurization": "ON",
  "unitHandling": "VERIFY",
  "nanHandling": "OFF",
  "language": "FASTEXPR",
  "maxTrade": "OFF"
}
```

Expression:
```text
group_rank(ts_rank(est_eps/close, 60),industry)
```

## Short-Term Sentiment Volume Stability

Hypothesis
A high 10-day standard deviation of sentiment volume for a stock means that investor attention is unstable, with frequent spikes and drops in how much the stock is discussed. This unstable attention is often driven by short-lived news or hype and may lead to noisy, unsustainable price moves, causing the stock to underperform afterward.

Implementation
Take the 10-day rolling standard deviation of relative sentiment volume scl12_buzz and negate it.

Hint to improve the Alpha
Would observing stability over a shorter horizon be more effective for more liquid stocks?

### Simulation Example

Settings:
```json
{
  "instrumentType": "EQUITY",
  "region": "USA",
  "universe": "TOP3000",
  "delay": 1,
  "decay": 0,
  "neutralization": "INDUSTRY",
  "truncation": 0.08,
  "pasteurization": "ON",
  "unitHandling": "VERIFY",
  "nanHandling": "OFF",
  "language": "FASTEXPR",
  "maxTrade": "OFF"
}
```

Expression:
```text
-ts_std_dev(scl12_buzz, 10)
```
